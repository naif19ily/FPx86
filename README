    Tiny printf for x86 programs

    This function must be called giving the following arguments:
      - rdi:    Stores the printing format
      - rsi:    fd where to write the final string

    The supported formats are:
      - s:      strings
      - d:      numbers
      - c:      characters

    Arguments must be pushed into the stack, therefore, they shall
    be given in the inverse order they are used in the format e.g.

        format: .string "today is %s, also it's the %dth month, my name starts with '%c' letter."
        day:    .string "jueves"   `-----.           `__________________,            |
                                         |.___________.                 |            |
        leaq    day(%rip), %rax                       |                 |            |
        pushq   %rax                                string argument     |            |
        pushq   $4                                  number argument-----'            |
        pushq   $'J'                                character argument---------------`
        leaq    format(%rip), %rdi
        movq    STDOUT(%rip), %rsi
        call    fpx86
        pushq   $24, %rsp -----------------.
                                           v
    right after calling fpx86, the programmer must to add 8 * NoArgs bytes to rsp, this
    must be done since rsp was alterated.
